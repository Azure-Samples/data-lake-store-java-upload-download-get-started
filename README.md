# Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1: Getting Started

This sample demonstrates how to interact with the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 service using the Java SDK. The sample walks through the three main steps:
- Acquire an Azure ActiveDirectory OAuth token
- Create a client object
- Use the methods on the client object to interact with the store

Once you understand the sample, you can look at the API Javadocs here: https://azure.github.io/azure-data-lake-store-java/javadoc/
